This web-based terminal project is the source code for U413.com. U413 contains a ton of database modeling and language integrated queries. All of that has been stripped out to reduce the complexity as well as eliminate any potential database security risks accidentally getting checked into source control. As I continue to develop U413, any changes I make that affect the base web-terminal functionality, I will check in those changes here for you to enjoy.

This project consists of the following server-side technologies:
- ASP.NET MVC 2.0
- C#

As well as the following client-side technologies:
- HTML
- Javascript/JQuery
- Ajax

The project was coded and compiled in Visual Studio 2010/.NET 4.0.
